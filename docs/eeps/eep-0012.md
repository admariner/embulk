Obsolete Execution as a Command
================================

Background
-----------

Embulk has provided a method to run it as a simple command `embulk` on the command line as illustrated by the examples below.

```
embulk run postgresql-example.yml
```

```
embulk guess s3-incomplete-example.yml -o s3-example.yml
```

```
embulk gem install embulk-input-s3
```

It has been implemented by embedding a shell script since [v0.4.6](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/commit/38b000d5c6be13ad4ea2818d3cf6ea67e9d86c51) (a batch file for Windows since [v0.6.11](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/pull/192)) in Embulk's distributed "executable" JAR files to emit a `java` command with some command-line options configured.

### Java's versioning and release strategy

This worked well as long as Embulk expected almost the singular version of Java, which was Oracle's Java 7 (up to Embulk v0.8), or [Java 8 (since Embulk v0.9)](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/pull/853).

However, Java has changed its versioning and release strategy since Java 9. Java has much more frequent major releases twice a year, and a variety of Java runtimes are released by many organizations, such as [Oracle's](https://www.oracle.com/java/), [Red Hat's](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview), [Azul's Zulu](https://www.azul.com/products/core/), [Adoptium's Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/), [Amazon's Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/en/corretto/), Ubuntu's own builds, and more.

Unfortunately, they differ from each other. Different versions obviously have different command-line options. Furthermore, even within the same version, different distributions may have different command-line options and behaviors.

As discussed in [EEP-8: Milestones to Embulk v1.0, and versioning strategies to follow](./eep-0008.md) and [EEP-11: Moving Forward Together with Modern Java](./eep-0011.md), Embulk would target a range of Java versions, not just a single version at a time. Also, of course, Embulk should not limit the Java distributions it runs on.

The embedded shell script (and batch file) would still need to cover those variations of Java versions and distributions, but there are too many Java variations in the world to cover, and shell scripts (and batch files) are not so powerful to cover such complexity. On the other hand, depending on another scripting runtime (such as Ruby or Python) would add another complex dependency to the Embulk ecosystem.

### Embulk's use-cases in the wild

The `embulk` command to run Embulk has been provided for ease of use, especially for users running Embulk on their computers in front of them.

However, looking around the recent use-cases of Embulk in the wild from feedback, Embulk is mostly running on servers as part of their data pipelines. Running Embulk from the command line is not a popular use-case anymore.

If maintaining the embedded shell script were not that hard, or if many users were still running Embulk from the command line, it might be worth keeping the `embulk` command. But this is not the case.

The `embulk` command to be obsolete
------------------------------------

Looking through the recent background situation, we have decided to no longer maintain the `embulk` command.

The `embulk` command has been really just "syntax sugar". Embulk's "executable" JAR files are JAR files. Users have already been able to run Embulk with their own `java` commands as illustrated by the examples below.

```
java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar embulk-0.11.5.jar run postgresql-example.yml
```

```
java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -Xverify:none -jar embulk-0.11.5.jar guess s3-incomplete-example.yml -o s3-example.yml
```

```
java -jar embulk-0.11.5.jar -Xjruby=file:///home/user/jruby-complete-9.1.15.0.jar gem install embulk-input-s3
```

Users won't need any special migration period, as they have already been able to run Embulk with the `java` command for a long time. Users would simply need to change their `embulk` commands to `java`-based commands before upgrading their Embulk to a version that no longer provides the `embulk` command.

The `java`-based commands would also benefit users by giving them more explicit control and visibility over their Java setup. Users will have explicit control over which Java version to run Embulk on, and which Java options to set for Embulk.

### Announcement

Even though we don't technically need a special migration period, users would still need a clear announcement before the `embulk` command is removed, and a grace period before it is enforced.

First, [a GitHub Issue #1496: "Deprecate running Embulk by a single 'embulk' command"](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues/1496) has been filed since February 2022, and we have received no complaints there as of September 2024.

Second, since [Embulk v0.10.36](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/releases/tag/v0.10.36) as of June 2022, Embulk has started to display the following warning message when run with the `embulk` command.

```
================================== [ NOTICE ] ==================================
 Embulk will not be executable as a single command, such as 'embulk run'.
 It will happen at some point in v0.11.*.

 Get ready for the removal by running Embulk with your own 'java' command line.
 Running Embulk with your own 'java' command line has already been available.

 For instance in Java 1.8 :
  java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar embulk-X.Y.Z.jar run ...
  java -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -Xverify:none -jar embulk-X.Y.Z.jar guess ...

 See https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues/1496 for the details.
================================================================================
```

Finally, an announcement has been made at "[Embulk v0.11 is coming soon](https://www.embulk.org/articles/2023/04/13/embulk-v0.11-is-coming-soon.html)" on `www.embulk.org` as of April 2023.

As of this EEP, a year has already passed since Embulk v0.11 was released, and the announcement was made on `www.embulk.org`.

### Enforcement

Sufficient announcements have been already made.

The `embulk` command will be actually removed along with releasing some version during Embulk v0.11.
